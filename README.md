<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>My goal in the design was to make it easy as possible to locate and access information on the site.
I added some simple animations to make the website more interactive. 
The color scheme was picked to create a nice but simple contrast to give the website a modern feel. </p>


<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>For the Atomotive enthusiasts, I wanted to provide them with an overview of what my opion is on cars . All the information they need 
is right infront of them, with the option to contact me if they had a question. </p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>In all the sections, I wanted everything to be simple and easy to find. My layout was easy to follow and effective, 
by having 5 clear sections that had exact purposes. </p>

# Features

<p>This Navbar is responsive, it will collapse down while on a mobile device. The naviagtion changes colour when scrolling past the callout.
I used scroll-spy to make the Navigation through the site smoother and for ease of use.</p>

<h3>Features Left to Implement</h3>

<p>In the future, I would like link all the reviews to my very own blog and make a buisness out of this website.
I would like to do branding and marketing to promote Dailydriverss as a blog/reviews wesbite for all automotive enthusiasts.
