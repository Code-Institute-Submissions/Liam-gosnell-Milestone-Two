<p>Stream Two Project: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute<p>

<p> This is a website based on my idea of a car review wesbite.
This website showcases Car reviews, Images, Social media posts, a  google maps api for locations for factorys, youtube videos and a contact page.
I have external links to review websites for each car , I used links from <a href="https://www.carwow.co.uk/">Carwow</a>.
</p>

<p>I decide to make a responsive and interactive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this website. 
Using HTML5 and CSS to make it responsive and applying the skills learned from the User-Centric Frontend 
module of Full Stack Web Developer course from Code Institute. 
This site uses Javascript to implement maps that show interactive markers for factorys.</p>

# Testing

<h4>Online checkers</h4>

2.<a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">JIGSAW W3C Validator</a> - For CSS.
3.<a href="https://jshint.com/">JsHint</a> - For Javascript.

<h4>Chrome Dev Tools</h4>
<p>I used Dev Tools to check if there was an error on my page. 
Then, I changed what was wrong in the dev tools and I would be able to see the changes in a live update into my browser.
Once I've found the issue I went back to gitpod and make the changes there.</p>

<h4>Manual Testing</h4>

<p>I have tested the website on:</p>

* Google Chrome
* Apple Safari
* Internet Explorer
* Mozilla Firefox

<h4>Devices</h4>

<h4>De-Bugging</h4>

<p>During the process of this website, I found little bugs but nothing I couldn't fix.</p>

<p>A good example of this is when the website goes responsive on mobile devices the images change to scaled down versions.
Also the arrow down animations scale down on mobile devices.</p>
