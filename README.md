I added some simple animations to make the website more interactive. 
The color scheme was picked to create a nice but simple contrast to give the website a modern feel. </p>


<h2>Scope</h2>

is right infront of them, with the option to contact me if they had a question. </p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>In all the sections, I wanted everything to be simple and easy to find. My layout was easy to follow and effective, 
by having 5 clear sections that had exact purposes. </p>

# Testing

<h4>Online checkers</h4>
* <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">W3C Validator</a> - For HTML.
* <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">JIGSAW W3C Validator</a> - For CSS.
* <a href="https://jshint.com/">JsHint</a> - For Javascript.

<h4>Chrome Dev Tools</h4>
<p>I used Dev Tools to check if there was an error on my page. 
Then, I changed what was wrong in the dev tools and I would be able to see the changes in a live update into my browser.
Once I've found the issue I went back to gitpod and make the changes there.</p>

<h4>Manual Testing</h4>

<p>I have tested the website on:</p>

* Google Chrome
* Apple Safari
* Internet Explorer
* Mozilla Firefox

<h4>Devices</h4>

* Iphone X
* Iphone 8
* Iphone 6/7
* iPad 
* iPad Pro
* Pixel
* Pixel 2XL

<h4>De-Bugging</h4>

<p>During the process of this website, I found little bugs but nothing I couldn't fix.</p>

<p>A good example of this is when the website goes responsive on mobile devices the images change to scaled down versions.
Also the arrow down animations scale down on mobile devices.</p>
